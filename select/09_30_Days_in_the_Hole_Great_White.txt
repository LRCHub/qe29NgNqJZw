Roll my tape
Thirty days
Anyone doing that one?
I'm doing that one
Thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole all right all right all right all right

Chicago green talking about black lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon give me my release come on
Black napalese it's got you weak in your knees
Just sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on you know it's hard to believe

Thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole that's what they give you I know thirty days in the hole

Newcastle brown I'm telling you it can sure smack you down
Take a greasy whore and a rolling dance floor it's got your head spinning around
If you live on the road well there's a new highway code
You take the urban noise with some dirt with poison it's going to lessen your load

Thirty days in the hole that's what they give you now thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole all right all right now thirty days in the hole

What you doing boy? you're here for thirty days
Come on get your long hair cut and cut out your ways

Black napalese it got you weak in your knees
Going to sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on you know it's so hard to please
Newcastle brown can sure smack you down
You take a greasy whore and a rolling dance floor you know you're jailhouse bound

Thirty days in the hole that's what they give you now thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole all right now thirty days in the hole
Thirty days thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
